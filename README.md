# OS161
Implementation of some of the system calls in OS161
These source files encompass a selection of system calls, 
including read, write, open, close, exit, dup2, getwd, chdir, fork, and execv. 
However, it's important to note that these system calls have been implemented 
separately for individual testing purposes and are insufficient for constructing 
a fully functional shell.
